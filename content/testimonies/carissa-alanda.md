Collaborating with Nathan has been nothing but a blessing. Not only he delivers his tasks in timely manner, but he would ask many questions prior development to ensure that he could build something that can help us reach the goal. As PM, these traits help me tremendously as I could rely on Nathan for any technicalities so that we can come up with other that meets the business goals while maintaining the user needs.
